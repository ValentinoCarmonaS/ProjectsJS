# JAVASCRIPT ALGORITHM AND DATA STRUCTURES CERTIFICATION  
## Course Repository Overview  

---

### **COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
This repository documents my progress through the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification program. The curriculum focuses on mastering JavaScript fundamentals, including variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, and DOM manipulation. Advanced topics such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, API data fetching, and `localStorage` usage are also covered.  

Projects range from foundational exercises to certification-required applications, demonstrating practical implementation of JavaScript concepts.
